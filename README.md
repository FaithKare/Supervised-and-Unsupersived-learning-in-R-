# Supervised-and-Unsupersived-learning-in-R-

## Description
For supervised learning, a Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like help identifying which individuals are most likely to click on her ads. Given this business problem, the R program will be used to build a model that can predict whether an individual will click or not click on the ad.

For unsupervised learning, a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia through its Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customerâ€™s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups. R will be used to perform clustering, stating insights drawn from the analysis and visualizations. K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering will be compared, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of this analysis.

## Technologies Used
R program in google colab 

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to use the datasets in question to perform both Supervised and Unsupervised learning in R. Drawing imsights that could prove useful to a business such as informing strategies in marketing and sales of the brand.
